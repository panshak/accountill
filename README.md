## Introduction
This is a side project I've been working on. A full stack invoicing application made using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React & Nodejs), specially designed for freelancers and small businesses, but can be used for almost any type of business need. With this application, you can send beautiful invoices, receipts, estimates, quotes, bills etc to your clients. Jump right off the [Live App](https://arcinvoice.com/) and start sending invoice or download the entire [Source code](https://github.com/Panshak/arcinvoice) and run it on your server. This project is something I've been working on in my free time so I cannot be sure that everything will work out correctly. But I'll appreciate you if can report any issue.

## Configuration and Setup
In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine. 
- Open the project in your prefered code editor.
- Go to terminal -> New terminal (If you are using VS code)
- Split your terminal into two (run the client on one terminal and the server on the other terminal)

In the first terminal
- cd client and create a .env file in the root of your client directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = 
REACT_APP_API = http://localhost:5000
REACT_APP_URL = http://localhost:3000

```

To get your Google ClientID for authentication, go to the [credential Page ](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) (if you are new, then [create a new project first](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) and follow the following steps;

- Click Create credentials > OAuth client ID.
- Select the Web application type.
- Name your OAuth client and click Create
- Remember to provide your domain and redirect URL so that Google identifies the origin domain to which it can display the consent screen. In development, that is going to be `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Copy the Client ID and assign it to the variable `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in your .env file

```
$ cd client
$ npm install (to install client-side dependencies)
$ npm start (to start the client)
```
In the second terminal
- cd server and create a .env file in the root of your server directory.
- Supply the following credentials

```
DB_URL = 
PORT = 5000
SECRET = 
SMTP_HOST = 
SMTP_PORT = 
SMTP_USER = 
SMTP_PASS = 

```

Please follow [This tutorial](https://dev.to/dalalrohit/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-atlas-using-node-js-k9i) to create your mongoDB connection url, which you'll use as your DB_URL

```
$ cd server
$ npm install (to install server-side dependencies)
& npm start (to start the server)
```

## Troubleshooting
If you're getting error while trying to send or download PDF,
please run the following in your server terminal.

```
$ npm install html-pdf -g
$ npm link html-pdf
$ npm link phantomjs-prebuilt
```


## Comment
I intend to keep adding more features to this application, so if you like it, please give it a star, that will encourage me to 
to keep improving the project.
